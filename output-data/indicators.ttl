Web page for National Indicator 186 http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/statistics/indicators/ni186/ni186.aspx DECC publish two sets of information for local authority carbon dioxide emissions. The data presented here are those used for National Indicator 186- carbon dioxide emissions per capita. Some sectors of the UK national inventory are not included in the Local CO2 estimates because these could not be spatially disaggregated to LA level. These are off shore emissions from oil and gas extraction, domestic aviation emissions, fishing and coastal shipping. International aviation and shipping are excluded from the UK national inventory. In addition for the indicator, emissions associated with the following components have also been omitted. Motorways EU Emissions Trading Scheme sites (except energy suppliers, e.g. power stations in the scheme, whose emissions are indirectly included via the end user estimates, e.g. for electricity use) Diesel railways Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry In effect these are emissions that Local Authorities can be least expected to be responsible for. The general principle of the End User basis is that emissions are distributed according to the point of energy consumption (or point of emission if not energy related). Except for the energy industry, emissions from the production of goods are assigned to where the production takes place thus as with the national inventories, emissions from the production of goods which are exported will be included, and emissions from the production of goods which are imported are excluded. The End User basis for reporting emissions has been chosen for this dataset because it fully accounts for the emissions from energy use at the local level and does not penalise local areas for emissions from the production of energy which is then exported to other areas. Please see below for more details on the methodology used to calculate the data presented in this section. http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/statistics/climate_change/gg_emissions/uk_emissions/2008_local/2008_local.aspx ]]>"@en-gb ;

The data presented here are those used for National Indicator 186- carbon dioxide emissions per capita. The general principle of the End User basis is that emissions are distributed according to the point of energy consumption (or point of emission if not energy related). Except for the energy industry, emissions from the production of goods are assigned to where the production takes place thus as with the national inventories, emissions from the production of goods which are exported will be included, and emissions from the production of goods which are imported are excluded. The End User basis for reporting emissions has been chosen for this dataset because it fully accounts for the emissions from energy use at the local level and does not penalise local areas for emissions from the production of energy which is then exported to other areas.

The general principle of the End User basis is that emissions are distributed according to the point of energy consumption (or point of emission if not energy related).

The End User basis for reporting emissions has been chosen for this dataset because it fully accounts for the emissions from energy use at the local level and does not penalise local areas for emissions from the production of energy which is then exported to other areas.

Each of the domains can also be ranked individually. Using the relative rankingseach data zone can be assigned to a vigintile for each domain and the overall index. Vigintile 1 is the most deprived 5% of Data Zones and vigintile 20 is the least deprived 5% of data zones. When comparing results from the different versions of the SIMD it is important to take into account changes to the methodology used to construct the individual domains and the overall SIMD between the three indices.

This figure comprises emissions from carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide for 1990 together with emissions for the fluorinated gases for 1995. This figure will be adjusted to take account of carbon trading by comparing the number of carbon units surrendered with the nominal allocation of units to Scotland. For the period 2005-2007 (Phase I of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)), in addition to units allocated to individual sites, Scotland will also take responsibility for a share of any UK allocation that is auctioned. The share to be used will equate to: Allocated units to Scottish sites/Allocated units to UK sites. The allocated units to be used will be those allocated for the year in which the auction takes place. For Phase I of the EU ETS, where a small amount of unused units from the New Entry Reserve were auctioned in 2007 (and where DECC have allocated the sales equally over the period 2005-2007), the units to be used will be those allocated for the whole of Phase I. Nominal Scottish allocations for the period 2008-2020 have been published by the Climate Change Committee in Table 1.4 of the Technical Appendix accompanying their report "Scotland's path to a low-carbon economy" ( http://downloads.theccc.org.uk/Scottish%20report/Technical%20Appendix%20Scotland%20v2.pdf ). The nominal allocations for the period 2010-2012 were also published in May 2010 as "specified amounts" in "The Carbon Accounting Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 2010" ( http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/ssi2010/pdf/ssi_20100216_en.pdf ). The accounting methodology in these Regulations describes in detail how the emissions are adjusted to take account of carbon trading. In summary, net greenhouse gas emissions are defined thus: Net greenhouse gas emissions = greenhouse gas emissions + units allocated - units surrendered]]>"""@en-gb ;

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 225 7972.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 225 7972.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 225 7972.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 225 7972.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 225 7972.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 225 7972.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 225 7972.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then.

The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 225 7972.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5.

Incapacity Benefits include Severe Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 225 7972.

The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 225 7972.

The definitions of income deprivation used in SIMD 2004, SIMD 2006 and SIMD 2009 are different and are based on recipients of slightly different means tested benefits due to changes in the benefits and tax credits system affecting data availability. Consequently care should be taken when interpreting differences between the data used in the different versions of the Index. A full list of indicators used are available in the corresponding Technical Report. Where the number of people who are income deprived is less than 5, the percentage of population who are income deprived has been suppressed to protect confidentiality. For 2005 data (SIMD 2006) data for higher geographies has been rounded to base five, for 2002 data (SIMD 2004) data for higher geographies is based on best fit data zone values. 2004 population estimates are used for SIMD 2006 data and Census 2001 population estimates are used for SIMD 2004 data. For SIMD 2009 (2008 data) the data has been probabalistically rounded to base 5.

Each of the domains can also be ranked individually. When comparing results from the SIMD 2004 and SIMD 2006 it is important to take into account changes to the methodology used to construct the individual domains and the overall SIMD between the two indices.

From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only available to people who are not required to be available for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC) replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October 2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the population aged 16-59 from the small the area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only available to people who are not required to be available for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC) replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October 2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the population aged 16-59 from the small the area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only available to people who are not required to be available for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC) replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October 2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the population aged 16-59 from the small the area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only available to people who are not required to be available for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC) replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October 2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the population aged 16-59 from the small the area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only available to people who are not required to be available for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC) replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October 2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the population aged 16-59 from the small the area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only available to people who are not required to be available for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC) replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October 2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the population aged 16-59 from the small the area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only available to people who are not required to be available for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC) replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October 2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the population aged 16-59 from the small the area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5.

From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only available to people who are not required to be available for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC) replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October 2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the population aged 16-59 from the small the area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only available to people who are not required to be available for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also considers the age of the partner.

For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the population aged 16-59 from the small the area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then.

From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only available to people who are not required to be available for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC) replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October 2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the population aged 16-59 from the small the area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

JSA replaced Unemployment Benefit and Income Support for unemployed people in October 1996. It is payable to people under pensionable age who are available for, and actively seeking work with some exclusions. There are contribution-based and income-based routes of entry to JSA. Income-based JSA is similar to Income Support and the majority of JSA recipients are expected to qualify through this route. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Jobseekers Allowance see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Jobseekerallowance/index.html Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error.

The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The scans from this source do not have accurate markers to indicate receipt of income based JSA or not. A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Due to low numbers it has not been possible to give information on duration on benefit, but this can be found via the claimant count on http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ . The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.

JSA replaced Unemployment Benefit and Income Support for unemployed people in October 1996. It is payable to people under pensionable age who are available for, and actively seeking work with some exclusions. There are contribution-based and income-based routes of entry to JSA. Income-based JSA is similar to Income Support and the majority of JSA recipients are expected to qualify through this route. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Jobseekers Allowance see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Jobseekerallowance/index.html Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age and gender from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The scans from this source do not have accurate markers to indicate receipt of income based JSA or not. A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Due to low numbers it has not been possible to give information on duration on benefit, but this can be found via the claimant count on http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ . The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates are calculated using the working age population (males aged 16-64 and females aged 16-59) from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Rates are not available prior to 2001 and may not be available for the latest quarter.Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5.

JSA replaced Unemployment Benefit and Income Support for unemployed people in October 1996. It is payable to people under pensionable age who are available for, and actively seeking work with some exclusions. There are contribution-based and income-based routes of entry to JSA. Income-based JSA is similar to Income Support and the majority of JSA recipients are expected to qualify through this route. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Jobseekers Allowance see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Jobseekerallowance/index.html Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age and gender from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The scans from this source do not have accurate markers to indicate receipt of income based JSA or not. A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Due to low numbers it has not been possible to give information on duration on benefit, but this can be found via the claimant count on http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ . The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates are calculated using the working age population (males aged 16-64 and females aged 16-59) from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Rates are not available prior to 2001 and may not be available for the latest quarter.Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5.

The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age and gender from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The scans from this source do not have accurate markers to indicate receipt of income based JSA or not. A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Due to low numbers it has not been possible to give information on duration on benefit, but this can be found via the claimant count on http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ . The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates are calculated using the working age population (males aged 16-64 and females aged 16-59) from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies.

JSA replaced Unemployment Benefit and Income Support for unemployed people in October 1996. It is payable to people under pensionable age who are available for, and actively seeking work with some exclusions. There are contribution-based and income-based routes of entry to JSA. Income-based JSA is similar to Income Support and the majority of JSA recipients are expected to qualify through this route. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Jobseekers Allowance see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Jobseekerallowance/index.html Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age and gender from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The scans from this source do not have accurate markers to indicate receipt of income based JSA or not. A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Due to low numbers it has not been possible to give information on duration on benefit, but this can be found via the claimant count on http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ . The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates are calculated using the working age population (males aged 16-64 and females aged 16-59) from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Rates are not available prior to 2001 and may not be available for the latest quarter.Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5.

There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by parliament, called the savings credit threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service website: www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

The awarded amount will depend on other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by parliament, called the savings credit threshold.

Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS.

There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by parliament, called the savings credit threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service website: www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS.

There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by parliament, called the savings credit threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service website: www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5.

There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by parliament, called the savings credit threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service website: www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5.

There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by parliament, called the savings credit threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service website: www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

The SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by parliament, called the savings credit threshold.

There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by parliament, called the savings credit threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service website: www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by parliament, called the savings credit threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service website: www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland.

There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by parliament, called the savings credit threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service website: www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area population estimates published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS.

SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate, IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP Website: http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html. Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are included within the area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16 plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59). Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small area population estimates provided by the General Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. Populations denominators for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this year, rates for these years will be published then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 225 7972.

This will support cross-departmental and inter-departmental policies such as those on social justice to allow early detection of national trends to allow detailed follow-up surveys of sub-samples from the main survey sample, if required. The survey questionnaire is in two parts. The highest income householder or their spouse/partner completes Part 1 of the interview. Once the composition of the household has been established, one of the adults in the household is randomly selected by the computer to complete Part 2. In all households with a single adult, the same person completes both parts but as the number of adults in the household increases, the probability of the random adult being the same as the household respondent declines. The household section of the interview deals with topics such as household composition, housing and tenure, health, access to the internet, cars available to the household, the occupation and industry of the highest income householder, household income, housing costs and childcare. The random adult section deals with individuals' housing change, tenure change, experiences of homelessness and housing problems, neighbourhood problems, transport and use of the internet, public transport, public services, income and employment. More information on the Methodology of the survey can be found on the SHS website at ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/16002/Methodology ) or the 2005/06 Methodology publication ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/07/30135546/0 ).

This will support cross-departmental and inter-departmental policies such as those on social justice to allow early detection of national trends to allow detailed follow-up surveys of sub-samples from the main survey sample, if required. The survey questionnaire is in two parts. The highest income householder or their spouse/partner completes Part 1 of the interview. Once the composition of the household has been established, one of the adults in the household is randomly selected by the computer to complete Part 2. In all households with a single adult, the same person completes both parts but as the number of adults in the household increases, the probability of the random adult being the same as the household respondent declines. The household section of the interview deals with topics such as household composition, housing and tenure, health, access to the internet, cars available to the household, the occupation and industry of the highest income householder, household income, housing costs and childcare. The random adult section deals with individuals' housing change, tenure change, experiences of homelessness and housing problems, neighbourhood problems, transport and use of the internet, public transport, public services, income and employment. More information on the Methodology of the survey can be found on the SHS website at ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/16002/Methodology ) or the 2005/06 Methodology publication ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/07/30135546/0 ).

This will support cross-departmental and inter-departmental policies such as those on social justice to allow early detection of national trends to allow detailed follow-up surveys of sub-samples from the main survey sample, if required. The survey questionnaire is in two parts. The highest income householder or their spouse/partner completes Part 1 of the interview. Once the composition of the household has been established, one of the adults in the household is randomly selected by the computer to complete Part 2. In all households with a single adult, the same person completes both parts but as the number of adults in the household increases, the probability of the random adult being the same as the household respondent declines. The household section of the interview deals with topics such as household composition, housing and tenure, health, access to the internet, cars available to the household, the occupation and industry of the highest income householder, household income, housing costs and childcare. The random adult section deals with individuals' housing change, tenure change, experiences of homelessness and housing problems, neighbourhood problems, transport and use of the internet, public transport, public services, income and employment. More information on the Methodology of the survey can be found on the SHS website at ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/16002/Methodology ) or the 2005/06 Methodology publication ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/07/30135546/0 ).

This will support cross-departmental and inter-departmental policies such as those on social justice to allow early detection of national trends to allow detailed follow-up surveys of sub-samples from the main survey sample, if required. The survey questionnaire is in two parts. The highest income householder or their spouse/partner completes Part 1 of the interview. Once the composition of the household has been established, one of the adults in the household is randomly selected by the computer to complete Part 2. In all households with a single adult, the same person completes both parts but as the number of adults in the household increases, the probability of the random adult being the same as the household respondent declines. The household section of the interview deals with topics such as household composition, housing and tenure, health, access to the internet, cars available to the household, the occupation and industry of the highest income householder, household income, housing costs and childcare. The random adult section deals with individuals' housing change, tenure change, experiences of homelessness and housing problems, neighbourhood problems, transport and use of the internet, public transport, public services, income and employment. More information on the Methodology of the survey can be found on the SHS website at ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/16002/Methodology ) or the 2005/06 Methodology publication ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/07/30135546/0 ).

This will support cross-departmental and inter-departmental policies such as those on social justice to allow early detection of national trends to allow detailed follow-up surveys of sub-samples from the main survey sample, if required. The survey questionnaire is in two parts. The highest income householder or their spouse/partner completes Part 1 of the interview. Once the composition of the household has been established, one of the adults in the household is randomly selected by the computer to complete Part 2. In all households with a single adult, the same person completes both parts but as the number of adults in the household increases, the probability of the random adult being the same as the household respondent declines. The household section of the interview deals with topics such as household composition, housing and tenure, health, access to the internet, cars available to the household, the occupation and industry of the highest income householder, household income, housing costs and childcare. The random adult section deals with individuals' housing change, tenure change, experiences of homelessness and housing problems, neighbourhood problems, transport and use of the internet, public transport, public services, income and employment. More information on the Methodology of the survey can be found on the SHS website at ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/16002/Methodology ) or the 2005/06 Methodology publication ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/07/30135546/0 ).

HMRC identified that they had provided incorrect tax credit data for the income domain of SIMD 2009 and this affected the income domain rank, the overall SIMD rank and the percentage of the population who are income deprived. This data has now been corrected on SNS. Further details can be found on the news page of the SIMD website: http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/SIMD/News The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) provides a relative ranking of the data zones in Scotland from 1 (most deprived) to 6505 (least deprived) based on a weighted combination of data in the domains of Current Income, Housing, Health, Education, Skills and Training, Employment and Geographic Access and Crime (no Crime data available for the SIMD 2004). Each of the domains can also be ranked individually. When comparing results from the different versions of the SIMD it is important to take into account changes to the methodology used to construct the individual domains and the overall SIMD between the three indices. More information (including a guidance leaflet, a general report, a statistical compendium and a technical report) can be found at www.scotland.gov.uk/simd .

Each of the domains can also be ranked individually. Using the relative rankingseach data zone can be assigned to a vigintile for each domain and the overall index. Vigintile 1 is the most deprived 5% of Data Zones and vigintile 20 is the least deprived 5% of data zones. When comparing results from the different versions of the SIMD it is important to take into account changes to the methodology used to construct the individual domains and the overall SIMD between the three indices. More information (including a guidance leaflet, a general report, a statistical compendium and a technical report) can be found at www.scotland.gov.uk/simd .

Pensions are based on National Insurance (NI) contributions. Additional money is paid to those aged 80 and over.A married personwho does not qualify fora full State Pension based ontheir own NI contributions,may be able to get a pension based ontheirspouse's NI record. For detailed eligibility conditions and rules for claiming State Pension see the pension service website: http://www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/. Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total claimants and breakdowns by age and gender from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable to the annual individual level data previously released as they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and removals from the systems. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential information and all counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries email: disseminationteam@dwp.gsi.gov.uk: Tel 0191 22 57972.

For example, a school leaver who left in June 2009 and travelled for several months but who is known to have taken up employment prior to September will be counted under 'employment' for the 2008 figures (because they left at the end of the 2008/09 year). For more information please see the publication Destinations of Leavers from Scottish Schools which is available at the following link http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/Publications Employment : includes those who are employed and who are in receipt of payment from their employers. It includes young people undertaking training in employment through Skillseekers and Modern Apprenticeships. From 2007, it also includes young people participating in Voluntary Work (previously this would have been included under Unemployed and Not Seeking Work).]]>"@en-gb ;

Additional Support Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are categorised as having Additional Support Needs. The data relate to the latest known destination of leavers in the September of the school year after they left. For example, a school leaver who left in June 2009 and travelled for several months but who is known to have taken up employment prior to September will be counted under 'employment' for the 2008 figures (because they left at the end of the 2008/09 year). For more information please see the publication Destinations of Leavers from Scottish Schools which is available at the following link http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/Publications Employment: includes those who are employed and who are in receipt of payment from their employers. It includes young people undertaking training in employment through Skillseekers and Modern Apprenticeships. From 2007, it also includes young people participating in Voluntary Work (previously this would have been included under Unemployed and Not Seeking Work)."@en-gb ;

For more information please see the publication Destinations of Leavers from Scottish Schools which is available at the following link http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/Publications Higher Education: includes leavers following HND (Higher National Diploma) or HNC (Higher National Certificate) courses, degree courses, courses for the education and training of teachers and higher level courses for professional qualifications. It also includes programmes at a level higher than the standard of the New National Qualifications (Intermediate 1, Intermediate 2, the new Higher) which were introduced in 1999/00, Advanced Higher, introduced in 2001, Scottish Certificate of Sixth Year Studies, and the National Certificate of Education of England, Wales or Northern Ireland at Advanced Level.

Unemployed and seeking employment or training : includes those who are registered with Skills Development Scotland and are known by them to be seeking employment or training. This is based on regular contact between Skills Development Scotland and the client. This does not refer to the definition of 'unemployed' used by the Benefits Agency to calculate published unemployment rates. Unemployed and not seeking employment or training: includes all those individuals who are not seeking employment or training for a range of reasons. The reasons may involve sickness, prison, pregnancy, caring for children or other dependents, or taking time out.

For example, a school leaver who left in June 2009 and travelled for several months but who is known to have taken up employment prior to September will be counted under 'employment' for the 2008 figures (because they left at the end of the 2008/09 year).

This is based on regular contact between Skills Development Scotland and the client. This does not refer to the definition of 'unemployed' used by the Benefits Agency to calculate published unemployment rates. Unemployed and not seeking employment or training: includes all those individuals who are not seeking employment or training for a range of reasons.

The data relate to the latest known destination of leavers in the September of the school year after they left. For example, a school leaver who left in June 2009 and travelled for several months but who is known to have taken up employment prior to September will be counted under 'employment' for the 2008 figures (because they left at the end of the 2008/09 year). For more information please see the publication Destinations of Leavers from Scottish Schools which is available at the following link http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/Publications. Unemployed and seeking employment or training: includes those who are registered with Skills Development Scotland and are known by them to be seeking employment or training. This is based on regular contact between Skills Development Scotland and the client. This does not refer to the definition of 'unemployed' used by the Benefits Agency to calculate published unemployment rates. Unemployed and not seeking employment or training: includes all those individuals who are not seeking employment or training for a range of reasons. The reasons may involve sickness, prison, pregnancy, caring for children or other dependents, or taking time out. NOTE: the above two categories are comparable to the single 'other known destination' which was used prior to 2002/03."@en-gb ;

The data relate to the latest known destination of leavers in the September of the school year after they left. For example, a school leaver who left in June 2009 and travelled for several months but who is known to have taken up employment prior to September will be counted under 'employment' for the 2008 figures (because they left at the end of the 2008/09 year). For more information please see the publication Destinations of Leavers from Scottish Schools which is available at the following link http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/Publications. Unemployed and seeking employment or training: includes those who are registered with Skills Development Scotland and are known by them to be seeking employment or training. This is based on regular contact between Skills Development Scotland and the client. This does not refer to the definition of 'unemployed' used by the Benefits Agency to calculate published unemployment rates. Unemployed and not seeking employment or training: includes all those individuals who are not seeking employment or training for a range of reasons. The reasons may involve sickness, prison, pregnancy, caring for children or other dependents, or taking time out."@en-gb ;

For more information please see the publication Destinations of Leavers from Scottish Schools which is available at the following link http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/Publications. Unemployed and seeking employment or training: includes those who are registered with Skills Development Scotland and are known by them to be seeking employment or training. This is based on regular contact between Skills Development Scotland and the client. This does not refer to the definition of 'unemployed' used by the Benefits Agency to calculate published unemployment rates. Unemployed and not seeking employment or training: includes all those individuals who are not seeking employment or training for a range of reasons. The reasons may involve sickness, prison, pregnancy, caring for children or other dependents, or taking time out.

The data relate to the latest known destination of leavers in the September of the school year after they left. For example, a school leaver who left in June 2009 and travelled for several months but who is known to have taken up employment prior to September will be counted under 'employment' for the 2008 figures (because they left at the end of the 2008/09 year). For more information please see the publication Destinations of Leavers from Scottish Schools which is available at the following link http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/Publications. Unemployed and seeking employment or training: includes those who are registered with Skills Development Scotland and are known by them to be seeking employment or training. This is based on regular contact between Skills Development Scotland and the client. This does not refer to the definition of 'unemployed' used by the Benefits Agency to calculate published unemployment rates. Unemployed and not seeking employment or training: includes all those individuals who are not seeking employment or training for a range of reasons. The reasons may involve sickness, prison, pregnancy, caring for children or other dependents, or taking time out. NOTE: the above two categories are comparable to the single 'other known destination' which was used prior to 2002/03."@en-gb ;

Other destinations include Unemployed and Seeking Work, Unemployed and not Seeking Work, and Unknown. The data relate to the latest known destination of leavers in the March/April of the school year after they left. For example, a school leaver who left in June 2008 and travelled for several months but who is known to have taken up employment prior to March/April 2009 will be counted under 'Positive' for the 2007 figures (because they left at the end of the 2007/08 year).

Pupil Numbers: The number of pupils on the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e.the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net . A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode. This has been used to generate the number of pupils at various levels of geographical aggregation. Results contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode. Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as national figures published elsewhere. Exam Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil information from the Census using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e. the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.

Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e. the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode. This has been used to generate the number of pupils at various levels of geographical aggregation. Results contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode. Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as national figures published elsewhere. Exam Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil information from the Census using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e. the year the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode. This has been used to generate the number of pupils at various levels of geographical aggregation. Results contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode. Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are categorised as having Additional Support Needs.

Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e. the year the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode. This has been used to generate the number of pupils at various levels of geographical aggregation. Results contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode. Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil information from the Census using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e. the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.

Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e. the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode. This has been used to generate the number of pupils at various levels of geographical aggregation. Results contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode. Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil information from the Census using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e. the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode. This has been used to generate the number of pupils at various levels of geographical aggregation. Results contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode. Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil information from the Census using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e. the year the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode. This has been used to generate the number of pupils at various levels of geographical aggregation. Results contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode. Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil information from the Census using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e. the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode. This has been used to generate the number of pupils at various levels of geographical aggregation. Results contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode. Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are categorised as having Additional Support Needs.

Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e. the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode. This has been used to generate the number of pupils at various levels of geographical aggregation. Results contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode. Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil information from the Census using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons. For more information please see the background notes to the publication 'SQA Attainment and School Leaver Qualifications in Scotland', available here: http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/PubAttainment"@en-gb ;

Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown relates to that in which the Census was carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e. the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More information on the ScotXed project is available on www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode. This has been used to generate the number of pupils at various levels of geographical aggregation. Results contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode. Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil information from the Census using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

Net receipts from interest, profits and dividends abroad are also excluded. There are two measures of GDP, market prices and basic prices. The estimates produced for Scotland are measured in basic prices, which excludes taxes less subsidies on products (taxes on products include VAT and excise duties).

A negative gap indicates that annual GDP growth in Scotland is lower than in the Small EU Countries.

The Scotland level life expectancy estimate shown here is an unofficial figure for use only as a comparator for the corresponding sub-Scotland level figures. The official Scotland life expectancy estimate (based on interim life tables) is published by the Office for National Statistics. Local Authority and Scotland level life expectancy figures are National Statistics. Community Health Partnership life expectancy figures are not classed as National Statistics because they are based on small area population estimates (SAPES). Life expectancy at birth, like most statistics, is an estimate which is subject to a margin of error. Thus confidence intervals providing a range of values within which the true underlying life expectancy would lie are published by GROS alongside the estimated life expectancy at birth figures."@en-gb ;

The Scotland level life expectancy estimate shown here is an unofficial figure for use only as a comparator for the corresponding sub-Scotland level figures. The official Scotland life expectancy estimate (based on interim life tables) is published by the Office for National Statistics. Local Authority and Scotland level life expectancy figures are National Statistics. Community Health Partnership life expectancy figures are not classed as National Statistics because they are based on small area population estimates (SAPES). Life expectancy at birth, like most statistics, is an estimate which is subject to a margin of error. Thus confidence intervals providing a range of values within which the true underlying life expectancy would lie are published by GROS alongside the estimated life expectancy at birth figures."@en-gb ;

As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year population estimates for health boards were slightly different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that published on GROS for all years. Data zone population estimates are aggregated to create data for several other geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when aggregating the data zones."@en-gb ;

Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil registration system, which is considered to be virtually complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK. Migration is derived from the National Health Service Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI) for migration within the UK, and from the International Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going exercise to improve the quality of data zone population estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to be those with high levels of migration - for example, student areas."@en-gb ;

The sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going exercise to improve the quality of data zone population estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to be those with high levels of migration - for example, student areas."@en-gb ;

The SHCS can provide national estimates annually and for Local Authority estimates, due to the sample sample size, the most recent 3 years worth of data are combined. LA figures for Fuel Poverty can be found in a separate indicator. For more information see the SHCS website www.scotland.gov.uk/shcs"@en-gb ;

Prior to 2003, the Scottish House Condition Survey was conducted in 1991, 1996 and 2002 with sample sizes of around 15,000 paired social and physical households and dwellings. Since 2003, the SHCS moved to a continuous format with surveys annually for 2003/4, 2004/5, 2005/6, 2007 and 2008 with a sample size of around 3,000 paired cases per year. The SHCS can provide national estimates annually and for Local Authority estimates, due to the sample sample size, the most recent 3 years worth of data are combined. LA figures for Fuel Poverty can be found in a separate indicator. For more information see the SHCS website www.scotland.gov.uk/shcs"@en-gb ;
