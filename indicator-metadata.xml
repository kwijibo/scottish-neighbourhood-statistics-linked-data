        the occupied geriatric long stay beds from SMR50 or SMR01
        records. The Balance of Care/Continuing Care Census in
        September 2008 following the revision of the Scottish
        Governments formal guidance on NHS continuing health care.
        The census for the first time, provides a method of
        identifying all patients who are receiving NHS care that is
        on-going non-acute care, delivered as an inpatient and

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>This dataset contains a count
        of all people claiming Attendance Allowance for a duration
        of 12 or more months but less than 2 years, and is based on
        data extracted from the Department of Work and Pensions
        (DWP) Administrative Computer System, which is in turn
        derived from the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study
        (WPLS). The WPLS is based on 100% of claimants and is not
        subject to any sampling error. Breakdowns are also
        available by award rate, age, gender, and main disabling
        condition. Note that not all disaggregations are available
        for all geographies. Attendance Allowance (AA) is a tax
        free, non-contributory, non-means-tested contribution
        towards the disability-related extra cost of severely
        disabled people. AA is only available for people aged 65
        and over. It can be awarded for a fixed or and indefinite
        period. In order to qualify for receipt of AA people must
        have needed help with personal care for at least 6 months.
        The allowance is paid at two rates: higher rate - for those
        who need help with personal care throughout the day and
        during the night; and lower rate - for those who need help
        with personal care throughout the day or during the night.
        Terminally ill people automatically qualify for the higher
        rate and do not have to satisfy the qualifying period. The
        figures include those who have had their payment suspended,
        for example, if they are in hospital. For more detailed and
        up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming AA

        <sns:Relevance>Attendance Allowance data is included within

        Community Regeneration CPP and Community Regeneration Local

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>This dataset contains a count
        of all people claiming Attendance Allowance for a duration
        of 3 or more months but less than 6 months, and is based on
        data extracted from the Department of Work and Pensions
        (DWP) Administrative Computer System, which is in turn
        derived from the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study
        (WPLS). The WPLS is based on 100% of claimants and is not
        subject to any sampling error. Breakdowns are also
        available by award rate, age, gender, and main disabling
        condition. Note that not all disaggregations are available
        for all geographies. ttendance Allowance (AA) is a tax
        free, non-contributory, non-means-tested contribution
        towards the disability-related extra cost of severely
        disabled people. AA is only available for people aged 65
        and over. It can be awarded for a fixed or and indefinite
        period. In order to qualify for receipt of AA people must
        have needed help with personal care for at least 6 months.
        The allowance is paid at two rates: higher rate - for those
        who need help with personal care throughout the day and
        during the night; and lower rate - for those who need help
        with personal care throughout the day or during the night.
        Terminally ill people automatically qualify for the higher
        rate and do not have to satisfy the qualifying period. The
        figures include those who have had their payment suspended,
        for example, if they are in hospital. For more detailed and
        up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming AA
        see DWP Website:

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>This dataset contains a count
        of all people claiming Attendance Allowance for a duration
        of 6 or more months but less than 12 months, and is based
        on data extracted from the Department of Work and Pensions
        (DWP) Administrative Computer System, which is in turn
        derived from the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study
        (WPLS). The WPLS is based on 100% of claimants and is not
        subject to any sampling error. Breakdowns are also
        available by award rate, age, gender, and main disabling
        condition. Note that not all disaggregations are available
        for all geographies. Attendance Allowance (AA) is a tax
        free, non-contributory, non-means-tested contribution
        towards the disability-related extra cost of severely
        disabled people. AA is only available for people aged 65
        and over. It can be awarded for a fixed or and indefinite
        period. In order to qualify for receipt of AA people must
        have needed help with personal care for at least 6 months.
        The allowance is paid at two rates: higher rate - for those
        who need help with personal care throughout the day and
        during the night; and lower rate - for those who need help
        with personal care throughout the day or during the night.
        Terminally ill people automatically qualify for the higher
        rate and do not have to satisfy the qualifying period. The
        figures include those who have had their payment suspended,
        for example, if they are in hospital. For more detailed and
        up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming AA
        see DWP Website:

        (WPLS). The WPLS is based on 100% of claimants and is not
        subject to any sampling error. Breakdowns are also

        Attendance Allowance (AA) is a tax free, non-contributory,
        non-means-tested contribution towards the
        disability-related extra cost of severely disabled people.
        AA is only available for people aged 65 and over. It can be
        awarded for a fixed or and indefinite period. In order to
        qualify for receipt of AA people must have needed help with
        personal care for at least 6 months. The allowance is paid
        at two rates: higher rate - for those who need help with
        personal care throughout the day and during the night; and
        lower rate - for those who need help with personal care
        throughout the day or during the night. Terminally ill
        people automatically qualify for the higher rate and do not
        have to satisfy the qualifying period. The figures include
        those who have had their payment suspended, for example, if
        they are in hospital. For more detailed and up-to-date

        geographies.Attendance Allowance (AA) is a tax free,
        non-contributory, non-means-tested contribution towards the
        disability-related extra cost of severely disabled people.
        AA is only available for people aged 65 and over. It can be
        awarded for a fixed or and indefinite period. In order to
        qualify for receipt of AA people must have needed help with
        personal care for at least 6 months. The allowance is paid
        at two rates: higher rate - for those who need help with

        lower rate - for those who need help with personal care
        throughout the day or during the night. Terminally ill

        have needed help with personal care for at least 6 months.
        The allowance is paid at two rates: higher rate - for those

        during the night; and lower rate - for those who need help
        with personal care throughout the day or during the night.
        People who are terminally ill automatically qualify for the
        higher rate and do not have to satisfy the qualifying
        period. The figures include those who have had their
        payment suspended, for example, if they are in hospital.

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>This dataset contains a count
        of all female Attendance Allowance claimants, and is based
        on data extracted from the Department of Work and Pensions
        (DWP) Administrative Computer System, which is in turn
        derived from the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study
        (WPLS). The WPLS is based on 100% of claimants and is not
        subject to any sampling error. Breakdowns are also
        available by award rate, age, duration of current claim,
        and main disabling condition. Note that not all
        disaggregations are available for all geographies.
        Attendance Allowance (AA) is a tax free, non-contributory,
        non-means-tested contribution towards the
        disability-related extra cost of severely disabled people.
        AA is only available for people aged 65 and over. It can be
        awarded for a fixed or and indefinite period. In order to
        qualify for receipt of AA people must have needed help with
        personal care for at least 6 months. The allowance is paid
        at two rates: higher rate - for those who need help with
        personal care throughout the day and during the night; and
        lower rate - for those who need help with personal care
        throughout the day or during the night. Terminally ill
        people automatically qualify for the higher rate and do not
        have to satisfy the qualifying period. The figures include
        those who have had their payment suspended, for example, if
        they are in hospital. For more detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming AA see DWP

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>This dataset provides a count
        of all claimants of Attendance Allowance who are registered
        on the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)
        administrative system under the disabling condition
        category 'Blindness' (coded 'C'). DWP data is derived from
        their Work and ensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS). The WPLS
        is based on 100% of claimants and is not subject to any
        sampling error. Breakdowns are also available by award
        type, age, duration of current claim, and gender. Note that
        not all disaggregations are available for all geographies.
        Where more than one disabling condition is registered, the
        main one is presented in these statistics. Attendance
        Allowance (AA) is a tax free, non-contributory,
        non-means-tested contribution towards the
        disability-related extra cost of severely disabled people.
        AA is only available for people aged 65 and over. It can be
        awarded for a fixed or and indefinite period. In order to
        qualify for receipt of AA people must have needed help with
        personal care for at least 6 months. The allowance is paid
        at two rates: higher rate - for those who need help with
        personal care throughout the day and during the night; and
        lower rate - for those who need help with personal care
        throughout the day or during the night. Terminally ill
        people automatically qualify for the higher rate and do not
        have to satisfy the qualifying period. The figures include
        those who have had their payment suspended, for example, if
        they are in hospital. For more detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming AA see DWP

        AA is only available for people aged 65 and over. It can be

        qualify for receipt of AA people must have needed help with

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>This dataset contains a count
        of all claimants of Attendance Allowance who are registered
        on the Departmentfor Work and Pensions (DWP) administrative
        system under the disabling condition category 'Chest
        Disease' (coded 'J'). DWP data is derived from their Work
        and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS). The WPLS is based
        on 100% of claimants and is not subject to any sampling
        error. Breakdowns are also available by award type, age,
        duration of current claim, and gender. Note that not all
        disaggregations are available for all geographies. Where
        more than one disabling condition is registered, the main
        one is presented in these statistics. Attendance Allowance
        (AA) is a tax free, non-contributory, non-means-tested
        contribution towards the disability-related extra cost of
        severely disabled people. AA is only available for people
        aged 65 and over. It can be awarded for a fixed or and
        indefinite period. In order to qualify for receipt of AA
        people must have needed help with personal care for at
        least 6 months. The allowance is paid at two rates: higher
        rate - for those who need help with personal care
        throughout the day and during the night; and lower rate -
        for those who need help with personal care throughout the
        day or during the night. Terminally ill people
        automatically qualify for the higher rate and do not have
        to satisfy the qualifying period. The figures include those
        who have had their payment suspended, for example, if they
        are in hospital. For more detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming AA see DWP

        qualify for receipt of AA people must have needed help with
        personal care for at least 6 months. The allowance is paid
        at two rates: higher rate - for those who need help with
        personal care throughout the day and during the night; and
        lower rate - for those who need help with personal care
        throughout the day or during the night. Terminally ill
        people automatically qualify for the higher rate and do not
        have to satisfy the qualifying period. The figures include
        those who have had their payment suspended, for example, if
        they are in hospital. For more detailed and up-to-date

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>This dataset contains a count
        of all claimants of Attendance Allowance who are registered
        on the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)
        administrative system under the disabling condition
        category 'Skin Disease' (coded 'Q'). DWP data is derived
        from their Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS). The
        WPLS is based on 100% of claimants and is not subject to
        any sampling error. Breakdowns are also available by award
        type, age, duration of current claim, and gender. Note that
        not all disaggregations are available for all geographies.
        Where more than one disabling condition is registered, the
        main one is presented in these statistics. Attendance
        Allowance (AA) is a tax free, non-contributory,
        non-means-tested contribution towards the
        disability-related extra cost of severely disabled people.
        AA is only available for people aged 65 and over. It can be
        awarded for a fixed or and indefinite period. In order to
        qualify for receipt of AA people must have needed help with
        personal care for at least 6 months. The allowance is paid
        at two rates: higher rate - for those who need help with
        personal care throughout the day and during the night; and
        lower rate - for those who need help with personal care
        throughout the day or during the night. Terminally ill
        people automatically qualify for the higher rate and do not
        have to satisfy the qualifying period. The figures include
        those who have had their payment suspended, for example, if
        they are in hospital. For more detailed and up-to-date

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>This dataset contains a count
        of all people claiming Attendance Allowance for a duration
        of less than 3 months, and is based on data extracted from
        the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) Administrative
        Computer System, which is in turn derived from the Work and
        Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS). The WPLS is based on
        100% of claimants and is not subject to any sampling error.
        Breakdowns are also available by award rate, age, gender,
        and main disabling condition. Note that not all
        disaggregations are available for all geographies.
        Attendance Allowance (AA) is a tax free, non-contributory,
        non-means-tested contribution towards the
        disability-related extra cost of severely disabled people.
        AA is only available for people aged 65 and over. It can be
        awarded for a fixed or and indefinite period. In order to
        qualify for receipt of AA people must have needed help with
        personal care for at least 6 months. The allowance is paid
        at two rates: higher rate - for those who need help with
        personal care throughout the day and during the night; and
        lower rate - for those who need help with personal care
        throughout the day or during the night. Terminally ill
        people automatically qualify for the higher rate and do not
        have to satisfy the qualifying period. The figures include
        those who have had their payment suspended, for example, if
        they are in hospital. For more detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming AA see DWP

        Change. Web page for National Indicator 186
        http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/statistics/indicators/ni186/ni186.aspx
        DECC publish two sets of information for local authority
        carbon dioxide emissions. The data presented here are those
        used for National Indicator 186- carbon dioxide emissions
        per capita. Some sectors of the UK national inventory are
        not included in the Local CO2 estimates because these could
        not be spatially disaggregated to LA level. These are off
        shore emissions from oil and gas extraction, domestic
        aviation emissions, fishing and coastal shipping.
        International aviation and shipping are excluded from the
        UK national inventory. In addition for the indicator,
        emissions associated with the following components have
        also been omitted. Motorways EU Emissions Trading Scheme
        sites (except energy suppliers, e.g. power stations in the
        scheme, whose emissions are indirectly included via the end
        user estimates, e.g. for electricity use) Diesel railways
        Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry In effect these are
        emissions that Local Authorities can be least expected to
        be responsible for. The general principle of the End User
        basis is that emissions are distributed according to the
        point of energy consumption (or point of emission if not
        energy related). Except for the energy industry, emissions
        from the production of goods are assigned to where the
        production takes place thus as with the national
        inventories, emissions from the production of goods which
        are exported will be included, and emissions from the
        production of goods which are imported are excluded. The
        End User basis for reporting emissions has been chosen for
        this dataset because it fully accounts for the emissions
        from energy use at the local level and does not penalise
        local areas for emissions from the production of energy
        which is then exported to other areas. Please see below for
        more details on the methodology used to calculate the data
        presented in this section.

        DECC publish two sets of information for local authority
        carbon dioxide emissions. The data presented here are those
        used for National Indicator 186- carbon dioxide emissions
        per capita. The general principle of the End User basis is
        that emissions are distributed according to the point of
        energy consumption (or point of emission if not energy
        related). Except for the energy industry, emissions from
        the production of goods are assigned to where the
        production takes place thus as with the national
        inventories, emissions from the production of goods which
        are exported will be included, and emissions from the
        production of goods which are imported are excluded. The
        End User basis for reporting emissions has been chosen for
        this dataset because it fully accounts for the emissions
        from energy use at the local level and does not penalise
        local areas for emissions from the production of energy
        which is then exported to other areas. Please see below for
        more details on the methodology used to calculate the data
        presented in this section.

        <sns:Comparability>General Register Office for Scotland
        (GROS) reports on a definition of alcohol related deaths
        harmonised across the UK, based on the underlying cause of
        death; ie. the disease or injury which initiated the chain
        of morbid events leading directly to death. However, these
        estimates do not include all deaths which might reasonably
        be attributed to alcohol. They exclude deaths where an
        alcohol related condition was recorded as a contributory
        factor but was not selected as the underlying cause. A
        broader definition of an alcohol related death includes all
        deaths for which where there is any mention on the death
        certificate of an alcohol related condition. Data relating
        to both definitions are presented in Alcohol Statistics
        Scotland, 2009, published by Information Services Division
        of NHS Scotland. The indicator below is the GROS
        definition, which is also used in the Community Health
        Profiles.Estimates have also recently been made of a wider
        definition of mortality related to conditions where alcohol
        use is identifed as a risk factor, such as some forms of
        cancer. These are called population attributable fractions
        (available at http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/5964.html).
        However, the method which produced the estimates for 2003
        used survey data relating to that year, and one cannot
        simply apply the same fractions to other years: the report
        recommended (on page 24) that the fractions should be
        updated when more information is available from the
        Scottish Health Survey.</sns:Comparability>

        <sns:Comparability>General Register Office for Scotland
        (GROS) reports on a definition of alcohol related deaths
        harmonised across the UK, based on the underlying cause of
        death; ie. the disease or injury which initiated the chain
        of morbid events leading directly to death. However, these
        estimates do not include all deaths which might reasonably
        be attributed to alcohol. They exclude deaths where an
        alcohol related condition was recorded as a contributory
        factor but was not selected as the underlying cause. A
        broader definition of an alcohol related death includes all
        deaths for which where there is any mention on the death
        certificate of an alcohol related condition. Data relating
        to both definitions are presented in Alcohol Statistics
        Scotland, 2009, published by Information Services Division
        of NHS Scotland. The indicator below is the GROS
        definition, which is also used in the Community Health
        Profiles.Estimates have also recently been made of a wider
        definition of mortality related to conditions where alcohol
        use is identifed as a risk factor, such as some forms of
        cancer. These are called population attributable fractions
        (available at http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/5964.html).
        However, the method which produced the estimates for 2003
        used survey data relating to that year, and one cannot
        simply apply the same fractions to other years: the report
        recommended (on page 24) that the fractions should be
        updated when more information is available from the
        Scottish Health Survey.</sns:Comparability>

        http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/SIMD/News The
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) provides a
        relative ranking of the data zones in Scotland from 1 (most
        deprived) to 6505 (least deprived) based on a weighted
        combination of data in the domains of Current Income,
        Housing, Health, Education, Skills and Training, Employment
        and Geographic Access and Crime (no Crime data available
        for SIMD 2004). Each of the domains can also be ranked
        individually. Using the relative rankingseach data zone can
        be assigned to a vigintile for each domain and the overall
        index. Vigintile 1 is the most deprived 5% of Data Zones
        and vigintile 20 is the least deprived 5% of data zones.
        When comparing results from the different versions of the
        SIMD it is important to take into account changes to the
        methodology used to construct the individual domains and
        the overall SIMD between the three indices. More
        information (including a guidance leaflet, a general
        report, a statistical compendium and a technical report)
        can be found at www.scotland.gov.uk/simd . An SIMD

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>The ecological footprint is
        defined as a measure of how much biologically productive
        land and water an individual, population or activity
        requires to produce all the resources it consumes and to
        absorb the waste it generates using prevailing technology
        and resource management practices. The ecological footprint
        is usually measured in global hectares. Because trade is
        global, an individual or country's footprint includes land
        or sea from all over in the
        world.</sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>
        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Data available at Scotland level
        only.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>The indicator informs progress towards a
        Greener Scotland by measuring the sustainability of
        consumption. Reducing Scotland's ecological footprint will
        involve improving the efficiency of resource use as well as
        changing public behaviour. It also works towards a
        Wealthier and Fairer Scotland. The indicator informs
        progress in achieving prosperity in ways which make better
        use of and reduce the negative impacts which we have on
        natural resources, which are vital for present and future
        generations. Using resources more productively will help
        our businesses become more competitive in a global economy
        facing the challenges of climate change and scarce
        resources.</sns:Relevance>

        <gms:Description>The figure for 1990 is for the 1990 base
        year. This figure comprises emissions from carbon dioxide,
        methane and nitrous oxide for 1990 together with emissions
        for the fluorinated gases for 1995. This figure will be
        adjusted to take account of carbon trading by comparing the
        number of carbon units surrendered with the nominal
        allocation of units to Scotland. For the period 2005-2007
        (Phase I of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)), in
        addition to units allocated to individual sites, Scotland
        will also take responsibility for a share of any UK
        allocation that is auctioned. The share to be used will
        equate to: Allocated units to Scottish sites/Allocated
        units to UK sites. The allocated units to be used will be
        those allocated for the year in which the auction takes
        place. For Phase I of the EU ETS, where a small amount of
        unused units from the New Entry Reserve were auctioned in
        2007 (and where DECC have allocated the sales equally over
        the period 2005-2007), the units to be used will be those
        allocated for the whole of Phase I. Nominal Scottish
        allocations for the period 2008-2020 have been published by
        the Climate Change Committee in Table 1.4 of the Technical
        Appendix accompanying their report "Scotland's path to a
        low-carbon economy" (
        http://downloads.theccc.org.uk/Scottish%20report/Technical%20Appendix%20Scotland%20v2.pdf
        ). The nominal allocations for the period 2010-2012 were
        also published in May 2010 as "specified amounts" in "The
        Carbon Accounting Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 2010" (
        http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/ssi2010/pdf/ssi_20100216_en.pdf
        ). The accounting methodology in these Regulations
        describes in detail how the emissions are adjusted to take
        account of carbon trading. In summary, net greenhouse gas
        emissions are defined thus: Net greenhouse gas emissions =
        greenhouse gas emissions + units allocated - units
        surrendered]]&gt;</gms:Description>

        <gms:Description>Incapacity Benefits include Severe
        Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA
        was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between
        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html.
        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone
        population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available
        later this year, rates for these years will be published
        then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that
        data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP

        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone
        population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available
        later this year, rates for these years will be published
        then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that
        data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        <gms:Description>Incapacity Benefits include Severe
        Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA
        was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between
        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html.
        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher

        <gms:Description>Incapacity Benefits include Severe
        Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA
        was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between
        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html.
        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone
        population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available
        later this year, rates for these years will be published
        then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that
        data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone
        population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available
        later this year, rates for these years will be published
        then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that
        data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        <gms:Description>Incapacity Benefits include Severe
        Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA
        was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between
        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP

        <gms:Description>Incapacity Benefits include Severe
        Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA
        was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between
        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html.
        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone
        population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available
        later this year, rates for these years will be published
        then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that
        data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP
        Website:

        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone
        population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available
        later this year, rates for these years will be published
        then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that
        data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        <gms:Description>Incapacity Benefits include Severe
        Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA
        was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between
        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html.
        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General

        <gms:Description>Incapacity Benefits include Severe
        Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA
        was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between
        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html.
        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone
        population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available
        later this year, rates for these years will be published
        then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that
        data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP

        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone
        population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available
        later this year, rates for these years will be published
        then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that
        data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        <gms:Description>Incapacity Benefits include Severe
        Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA
        was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between
        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date

        for 2006Q04 at Scottish Parliamentary Constituency level
        was revised on 07 August 2007 due to figures being assigned
        to the wrong Constituencies. Incapacity Benefits include
        Severe Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit
        (IB). SDA was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere
        aged between 16 and 65 when they made their claim and been
        incapable of work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper
        age limit for receiving the allowance once it has been

        Benefits from April 1995. It is paid to people who are
        assessed as being incapable of work and who meet the
        appropriate contribution conditions. For people under state
        pension age there are two short-term rates: the lower rate,

        rate, IBLT, of Incapacity Benefit applies to people under
        state pension age who have been sick for more than a year.
        People with a terminal illness or who are receiving the
        highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance
        get the long-term rate from week 29. For people over state
        pension age, the short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit,
        based on Retirement Pension entitlement, is paid for up to
        a year if incapacity began before pension age. The
        long-term rate is not paid for people over pension age. For

        <gms:Description>Incapacity Benefits include Severe
        Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA
        was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between
        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP

        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone
        population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available

        <gms:Description>Incapacity Benefits include Severe
        Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA
        was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between
        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html.
        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone
        population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available
        later this year, rates for these years will be published
        then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that
        data do not allow the disclosure of confidential

        http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/SIMD/News The
        proportion of population who are income deprived is
        constructed for use as the income domain of the Scottish
        Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). The definitions of
        income deprivation used in SIMD 2004, SIMD 2006 and SIMD
        2009 are different and are based on recipients of slightly
        different means tested benefits due to changes in the
        benefits and tax credits system affecting data
        availability. Consequently care should be taken when
        interpreting differences between the data used in the
        different versions of the Index. A full list of indicators
        used are available in the corresponding Technical Report.
        Where the number of people who are income deprived is less
        than 5, the percentage of population who are income
        deprived has been suppressed to protect confidentiality.
        For 2005 data (SIMD 2006) data for higher geographies has
        been rounded to base five, for 2002 data (SIMD 2004) data
        for higher geographies is based on best fit data zone
        values. 2004 population estimates are used for SIMD 2006
        data and Census 2001 population estimates are used for SIMD
        2004 data. For SIMD 2009 (2008 data) the data has been
        probabalistically rounded to base 5. Further information
        about the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation including
        a general report and a technical report is available from:

        http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/SIMD/News The
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) provides a
        relative ranking of the data zones in Scotland from 1 (most

        combination of data in the domains of Current Income,
        Housing, Health, Education, Skills and Training, Employment
        and Geographic Access and Crime (no Crime data available

        <gms:Description>Income Support (IS) was introduced in
        April 1988 can be paid to a person aged 16 to 59 who is in
        Great Britain, is not working 16 hours or more a week and
        has less money coming in than the law says they need to
        live on. From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced
        Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only
        available to people who are not required to be available
        for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone
        parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal
        the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also
        considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC)
        replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October
        2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html.
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each
        Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three
        statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer
        or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups
        are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to
        the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a
        person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also
        receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into
        incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone
        Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents
        claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the
        Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot
        in time and will therefore exclude a small number of
        clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly
        intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August
        (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants
        who have an unknown age or gender are included within the
        area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns
        as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS
        datasets are not directly comparable to the annual
        individual level data previously released as they were a
        single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late
        notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the
        introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for
        claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the
        population aged 16-59 from the small the area population
        estimates published by the General Registrars Office for
        Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies
        are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are
        based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when
        2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population
        estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this
        year, rates for these years will be published then. Every
        effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not
        allow the disclosure of confidential information and all
        counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        <gms:Description>Income Support (IS) was introduced in
        April 1988 can be paid to a person aged 16 to 59 who is in
        Great Britain, is not working 16 hours or more a week and
        has less money coming in than the law says they need to
        live on. From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced
        Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only
        available to people who are not required to be available
        for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone
        parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal
        the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also
        considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC)
        replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October
        2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html.
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each
        Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three
        statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer
        or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups
        are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to
        the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a
        person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also
        receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into
        incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone
        Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents
        claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the
        Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot

        <gms:Description>Income Support (IS) was introduced in
        April 1988 can be paid to a person aged 16 to 59 who is in
        Great Britain, is not working 16 hours or more a week and
        has less money coming in than the law says they need to
        live on. From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced
        Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only
        available to people who are not required to be available
        for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone
        parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal
        the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also
        considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC)
        replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October
        2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html.
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each
        Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three
        statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer
        or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups
        are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to
        the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a
        person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also
        receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into
        incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone
        Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents
        claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the
        Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot
        in time and will therefore exclude a small number of
        clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly
        intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August
        (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants
        who have an unknown age or gender are included within the
        area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns
        as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS
        datasets are not directly comparable to the annual
        individual level data previously released as they were a
        single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late
        notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the
        introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for
        claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the
        population aged 16-59 from the small the area population
        estimates published by the General Registrars Office for
        Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies
        are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are
        based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when
        2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population
        estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this
        year, rates for these years will be published then. Every
        effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not
        allow the disclosure of confidential information and all
        counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        <gms:Description>Income Support (IS) was introduced in
        April 1988 can be paid to a person aged 16 to 59 who is in
        Great Britain, is not working 16 hours or more a week and
        has less money coming in than the law says they need to
        live on. From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced
        Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only
        available to people who are not required to be available
        for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone
        parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal
        the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also
        considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC)
        replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October
        2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html.
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each
        Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three
        statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer
        or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups
        are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to
        the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a
        person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also
        receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into
        incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone
        Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents
        claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the
        Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot
        in time and will therefore exclude a small number of
        clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly
        intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August
        (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants
        who have an unknown age or gender are included within the
        area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns
        as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS
        datasets are not directly comparable to the annual
        individual level data previously released as they were a
        single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late
        notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the
        introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for
        claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the
        population aged 16-59 from the small the area population
        estimates published by the General Registrars Office for
        Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies
        are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are
        based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when
        2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population
        estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this
        year, rates for these years will be published then. Every
        effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not
        allow the disclosure of confidential information and all
        counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        live on. From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced
        Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only
        available to people who are not required to be available
        for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone
        parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal
        the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also
        considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC)
        replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October
        2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html.
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each
        Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three
        statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer
        or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups
        are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to
        the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a
        person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also
        receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into
        incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone
        Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents
        claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the
        Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot
        in time and will therefore exclude a small number of
        clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly
        intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August
        (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants
        who have an unknown age or gender are included within the
        area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns
        as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS
        datasets are not directly comparable to the annual
        individual level data previously released as they were a
        single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late
        notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the
        introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for
        claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the
        population aged 16-59 from the small the area population
        estimates published by the General Registrars Office for
        Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies
        are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are
        based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when
        2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population
        estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this
        year, rates for these years will be published then. Every
        effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not
        allow the disclosure of confidential information and all
        counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        <gms:Description>Income Support (IS) was introduced in
        April 1988 can be paid to a person aged 16 to 59 who is in
        Great Britain, is not working 16 hours or more a week and
        has less money coming in than the law says they need to
        live on. From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced
        Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only
        available to people who are not required to be available
        for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone
        parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal
        the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also
        considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC)
        replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October
        2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html.
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each
        Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three
        statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer
        or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups
        are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to
        the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a
        person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also
        receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into
        incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone
        Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents
        claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the
        Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot
        in time and will therefore exclude a small number of
        clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly
        intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August
        (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants
        who have an unknown age or gender are included within the
        area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns
        as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS
        datasets are not directly comparable to the annual
        individual level data previously released as they were a
        single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late
        notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the
        introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for
        claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the
        population aged 16-59 from the small the area population
        estimates published by the General Registrars Office for
        Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies
        are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are
        based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when
        2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population
        estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this
        year, rates for these years will be published then. Every
        effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not
        allow the disclosure of confidential information and all
        counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into

        Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents
        claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the
        Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot
        in time and will therefore exclude a small number of
        clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly
        intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August
        (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants
        who have an unknown age or gender are included within the
        area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns
        as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS
        datasets are not directly comparable to the annual
        individual level data previously released as they were a
        single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late
        notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the
        introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for
        claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the
        population aged 16-59 from the small the area population
        estimates published by the General Registrars Office for
        Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies
        are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are

        <gms:Description>Income Support (IS) was introduced in
        April 1988 can be paid to a person aged 16 to 59 who is in
        Great Britain, is not working 16 hours or more a week and
        has less money coming in than the law says they need to
        live on. From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced
        Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only
        available to people who are not required to be available
        for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone
        parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal
        the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also
        considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC)
        replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October
        2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP

        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html.
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each
        Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three
        statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer
        or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups
        are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to
        the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a
        person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also
        receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into
        incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone
        Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents
        claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the
        Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot

        <gms:Description>Income Support (IS) was introduced in
        April 1988 can be paid to a person aged 16 to 59 who is in
        Great Britain, is not working 16 hours or more a week and
        has less money coming in than the law says they need to
        live on. From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced
        Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only
        available to people who are not required to be available
        for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone
        parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal
        the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also
        considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC)
        replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October
        2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html.
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each
        Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three
        statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer
        or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups
        are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to
        the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a
        person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also
        receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into
        incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone
        Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents
        claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the
        Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot
        in time and will therefore exclude a small number of
        clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly
        intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August
        (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants
        who have an unknown age or gender are included within the
        area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns
        as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS
        datasets are not directly comparable to the annual
        individual level data previously released as they were a
        single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late
        notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the
        introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for
        claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the
        population aged 16-59 from the small the area population
        estimates published by the General Registrars Office for
        Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies
        are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are
        based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when
        2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population
        estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this
        year, rates for these years will be published then. Every
        effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not
        allow the disclosure of confidential information and all
        counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        <gms:Description>Income Support (IS) was introduced in
        April 1988 can be paid to a person aged 16 to 59 who is in
        Great Britain, is not working 16 hours or more a week and
        has less money coming in than the law says they need to
        live on. From October 1996, Jobseekers Allowance replaced
        Income Support (IS) for unemployed people. IS is now only
        available to people who are not required to be available
        for work such as carers, sick and disabled people and lone
        parents. The number of pensioner claimants will not equal
        the number of claimants aged 60 or over, as it also
        considers the age of the partner. Pension Credit (PC)
        replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in October
        2003, PC claimants are shown separately. For detailed
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming IS see DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Incomesupport/index.html.
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit, partnering and by statistical group. Each
        Income Support claimant has been assigned to one of three
        statistical groups: Incapacity Benefits; Lone Parent; Carer
        or Others on Income Related Benefits. Statistical groups
        are arranged hierarchically and claimants are assigned to
        the highest statistical group that they belong to. Thus a
        person who claims Income Support as a Lone Parent and also
        receives Incapacity Benefit would be classified into
        incapacity benefits group. For this reason the group Lone
        Parent, for example will not contain all lone parents
        claiming Income Support. Some will be included in the
        Incapacity Benefits group instead. The data is a snapshot
        in time and will therefore exclude a small number of
        clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at quarterly
        intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2), August
        (Q3) and November (Q4). The very small number of claimants
        who have an unknown age or gender are included within the
        area total but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns
        as they pose a small disclosure risk. The data in the WPLS
        datasets are not directly comparable to the annual
        individual level data previously released as they were a
        single snapshot at a point in time and did not reflect late
        notifications and removals from the systems. Due to the
        introduction of Pension Credit, rates are only shown for
        claimants aged 16-59, these are calculated using the
        population aged 16-59 from the small the area population
        estimates published by the General Registrars Office for
        Scotland. Populations denominators for higher geographies
        are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005 rates are
        based on 2004 population estimates until October 2006 when
        2005 data will be added to SNS. Datazone population
        estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available later this
        year, rates for these years will be published then. Every
        effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not
        allow the disclosure of confidential information and all
        counts have been adjusted using a variant of controlled
        rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may
        not be a real zero. Source: Department for Work and

        http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/improvements_to_JSA.pdf
        Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) is a contributory or income
        based, taxable benefit. JSA replaced Unemployment Benefit
        and Income Support for unemployed people in October 1996.
        It is payable to people under pensionable age who are
        available for, and actively seeking work with some
        exclusions. There are contribution-based and income-based
        routes of entry to JSA. Income-based JSA is similar to
        Income Support and the majority of JSA recipients are
        expected to qualify through this route. For detailed and
        up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming
        Jobseekers Allowance see the DWP Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Jobseekerallowance/index.html

        quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2),
        August (Q3) and November (Q4). The scans from this source
        do not have accurate markers to indicate receipt of income
        based JSA or not. A very small number of claimants who have
        an unknown age or gender are included within the area total
        but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they
        pose a small disclosure risk. Due to low numbers it has not
        been possible to give information on duration on benefit,
        but this can be found via the claimant count on
        http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ . The data in the WPLS datasets
        are not directly comparable to the annual individual level
        data previously released as they were a single snapshot at
        a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and
        removals from the systems. Claim rates are calculated using
        the working age population (males aged 16-64 and females
        aged 16-59) from the small area population estimates
        published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland.
        Populations denominators for higher geographies are based
        on best-fit 2001 geographies. Rates are not available prior
        to 2001 and may not be available for the latest
        quarter.Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure
        that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential

        Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) is a contributory or income
        based, taxable benefit. JSA replaced Unemployment Benefit
        and Income Support for unemployed people in October 1996.
        It is payable to people under pensionable age who are
        available for, and actively seeking work with some
        exclusions. There are contribution-based and income-based
        routes of entry to JSA. Income-based JSA is similar to
        Income Support and the majority of JSA recipients are
        expected to qualify through this route. For detailed and
        up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming
        Jobseekers Allowance see the DWP Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Jobseekerallowance/index.html
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age and gender from a
        snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number
        of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at
        quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2),
        August (Q3) and November (Q4). The scans from this source
        do not have accurate markers to indicate receipt of income
        based JSA or not. A very small number of claimants who have
        an unknown age or gender are included within the area total
        but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they
        pose a small disclosure risk. Due to low numbers it has not
        been possible to give information on duration on benefit,
        but this can be found via the claimant count on
        http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ . The data in the WPLS datasets
        are not directly comparable to the annual individual level
        data previously released as they were a single snapshot at
        a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and
        removals from the systems. Claim rates are calculated using
        the working age population (males aged 16-64 and females
        aged 16-59) from the small area population estimates
        published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland.
        Populations denominators for higher geographies are based
        on best-fit 2001 geographies. Rates are not available prior
        to 2001 and may not be available for the latest
        quarter.Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure
        that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using a
        variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that
        are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source:

        Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) is a contributory or income
        based, taxable benefit. JSA replaced Unemployment Benefit
        and Income Support for unemployed people in October 1996.
        It is payable to people under pensionable age who are
        available for, and actively seeking work with some
        exclusions. There are contribution-based and income-based
        routes of entry to JSA. Income-based JSA is similar to
        Income Support and the majority of JSA recipients are
        expected to qualify through this route. For detailed and
        up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming
        Jobseekers Allowance see the DWP Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Jobseekerallowance/index.html
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age and gender from a
        snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number
        of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at
        quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2),
        August (Q3) and November (Q4). The scans from this source
        do not have accurate markers to indicate receipt of income
        based JSA or not. A very small number of claimants who have
        an unknown age or gender are included within the area total
        but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they
        pose a small disclosure risk. Due to low numbers it has not
        been possible to give information on duration on benefit,
        but this can be found via the claimant count on
        http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ . The data in the WPLS datasets
        are not directly comparable to the annual individual level
        data previously released as they were a single snapshot at
        a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and
        removals from the systems. Claim rates are calculated using
        the working age population (males aged 16-64 and females
        aged 16-59) from the small area population estimates
        published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland.
        Populations denominators for higher geographies are based
        on best-fit 2001 geographies. Rates are not available prior
        to 2001 and may not be available for the latest
        quarter.Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure
        that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using a
        variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that
        are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source:

        Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) is a contributory or income
        based, taxable benefit. JSA replaced Unemployment Benefit
        and Income Support for unemployed people in October 1996.
        It is payable to people under pensionable age who are
        available for, and actively seeking work with some
        exclusions. There are contribution-based and income-based
        routes of entry to JSA. Income-based JSA is similar to
        Income Support and the majority of JSA recipients are
        expected to qualify through this route. For detailed and
        up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming
        Jobseekers Allowance see the DWP Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Jobseekerallowance/index.html
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age and gender from a
        snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number
        of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at
        quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2),
        August (Q3) and November (Q4). The scans from this source
        do not have accurate markers to indicate receipt of income
        based JSA or not. A very small number of claimants who have
        an unknown age or gender are included within the area total
        but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they
        pose a small disclosure risk. Due to low numbers it has not
        been possible to give information on duration on benefit,
        but this can be found via the claimant count on
        http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ . The data in the WPLS datasets
        are not directly comparable to the annual individual level
        data previously released as they were a single snapshot at
        a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and
        removals from the systems. Claim rates are calculated using
        the working age population (males aged 16-64 and females
        aged 16-59) from the small area population estimates
        published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland.
        Populations denominators for higher geographies are based
        on best-fit 2001 geographies. Rates are not available prior
        to 2001 and may not be available for the latest
        quarter.Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure
        that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using a
        variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that
        are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source:

        <gms:Description>This data was revised in May 2008, full
        details of which can be found here:
        http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/improvements_to_JSA.pdf
        Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) is a contributory or income
        based, taxable benefit. JSA replaced Unemployment Benefit
        and Income Support for unemployed people in October 1996.
        It is payable to people under pensionable age who are
        available for, and actively seeking work with some
        exclusions. There are contribution-based and income-based
        routes of entry to JSA. Income-based JSA is similar to
        Income Support and the majority of JSA recipients are
        expected to qualify through this route. For detailed and
        up-to-date eligibility conditions and rules for claiming
        Jobseekers Allowance see the DWP Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/Jobseekerallowance/index.html
        Data shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age and gender from a
        snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a small number
        of clerically held cases. The snapshots are taken at
        quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1), May (Q2),
        August (Q3) and November (Q4). The scans from this source
        do not have accurate markers to indicate receipt of income
        based JSA or not. A very small number of claimants who have
        an unknown age or gender are included within the area total
        but excluded from the age and gender breakdowns as they
        pose a small disclosure risk. Due to low numbers it has not
        been possible to give information on duration on benefit,
        but this can be found via the claimant count on
        http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ . The data in the WPLS datasets
        are not directly comparable to the annual individual level
        data previously released as they were a single snapshot at
        a point in time and did not reflect late notifications and
        removals from the systems. Claim rates are calculated using
        the working age population (males aged 16-64 and females
        aged 16-59) from the small area population estimates
        published by the General Registrars Office for Scotland.
        Populations denominators for higher geographies are based
        on best-fit 2001 geographies. Rates are not available prior
        to 2001 and may not be available for the latest
        quarter.Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure
        that data do not allow the disclosure of confidential
        information and all counts have been adjusted using a
        variant of controlled rounding to base 5. Any counts that
        are shown as zero may not be a real zero. Source:

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>Biodegradable Municipal Waste
        (BMW) is municipal waste (MSW) that is capable of
        undergoing anaerobic or aerobic decomposition, such as
        food, garden waste, paper and card. Municipal Waste (MSW)
        is all waste for which the councils make arrangements, with
        the exclusion of: abandoned vehicles; road maintenance
        waste; commercial waste that is delivered to local
        authority owned or run landfill sites where the local
        authority has no part in the collection or disposal
        arrangements that have led to this delivery; industrial
        waste collected from industrial premises and taken for
        disposal or treatment separately from any other waste; and
        construction and demolition waste that is collected and
        taken for disposal or treatment separately from any other
        waste. Bricks and rubble taken to civic amenity sites are
        included in municipal waste.</sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>

        <gms:Description>Pension Credit (PC) were introduced on 6
        October 2003 to replace the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG).
        There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and
        the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for
        people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain
        level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on
        other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the
        standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing
        costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The
        SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have
        made some provision for their retirement (such as savings
        or a second pension) which brings their income above a
        level set by parliament, called the savings credit
        threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of
        guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and
        rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service
        website:
        www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data
        shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work
        and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject
        to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total
        claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on
        benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information.
        The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end
        of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4).
        A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or
        gender are included within the area total but excluded from
        the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small
        disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not

        based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area
        population estimates published by the General Registrars
        Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October

        the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for
        people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain
        level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on
        other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the
        standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing
        costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The
        SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have
        made some provision for their retirement (such as savings
        or a second pension) which brings their income above a
        level set by parliament, called the savings credit
        threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of
        guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and
        rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service
        website:
        www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data
        shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work
        and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject
        to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total
        claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on
        benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information.
        The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end
        of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4).
        A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or
        gender are included within the area total but excluded from
        the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small
        disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not
        directly comparable to the annual individual level data
        previously released as they were a single snapshot at a
        point in time and did not reflect late notifications and
        removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are
        based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area
        population estimates published by the General Registrars
        Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Every effort has
        been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the
        disclosure of confidential information and all counts have
        been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to
        base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real
        zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries

        claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on
        benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information.
        The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end
        of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4).
        A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or
        gender are included within the area total but excluded from
        the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small
        disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not
        directly comparable to the annual individual level data
        previously released as they were a single snapshot at a
        point in time and did not reflect late notifications and
        removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are
        based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area
        population estimates published by the General Registrars
        Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Every effort has
        been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the
        disclosure of confidential information and all counts have
        been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to
        base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real
        zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries

        <gms:Description>Pension Credit (PC) were introduced on 6
        October 2003 to replace the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG).
        There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and
        the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for
        people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain
        level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on
        other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the
        standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing
        costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The
        SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have
        made some provision for their retirement (such as savings
        or a second pension) which brings their income above a
        level set by parliament, called the savings credit
        threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of
        guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and
        rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service
        website:
        www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data

        <gms:Description>Pension Credit (PC) were introduced on 6
        October 2003 to replace the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG).
        There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and
        the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for
        people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain
        level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on
        other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the
        standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing
        costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The
        SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have
        made some provision for their retirement (such as savings
        or a second pension) which brings their income above a
        level set by parliament, called the savings credit
        threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of
        guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and
        rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service
        website:
        www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data
        shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work
        and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject
        to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total
        claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on
        benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information.
        The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end
        of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4).
        A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or
        gender are included within the area total but excluded from
        the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small
        disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not
        directly comparable to the annual individual level data
        previously released as they were a single snapshot at a
        point in time and did not reflect late notifications and
        removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are
        based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area
        population estimates published by the General Registrars
        Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Every effort has

        <gms:Description>Pension Credit (PC) were introduced on 6
        October 2003 to replace the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG).
        There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and
        the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for
        people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain
        level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on
        other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the
        standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing
        costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The
        SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have
        made some provision for their retirement (such as savings
        or a second pension) which brings their income above a
        level set by parliament, called the savings credit
        threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of
        guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and
        rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service
        website:
        www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data
        shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work
        and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject
        to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total
        claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on
        benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information.
        The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end
        of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4).
        A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or
        gender are included within the area total but excluded from
        the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small
        disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not
        directly comparable to the annual individual level data
        previously released as they were a single snapshot at a
        point in time and did not reflect late notifications and
        removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are
        based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area
        population estimates published by the General Registrars
        Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005

        <gms:Description>Pension Credit (PC) were introduced on 6
        October 2003 to replace the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG).
        There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and
        the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for
        people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain
        level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on
        other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the
        standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing
        costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The
        SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have
        made some provision for their retirement (such as savings
        or a second pension) which brings their income above a
        level set by parliament, called the savings credit
        threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of
        guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and
        rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service
        website:
        www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data
        shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work
        and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject
        to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total
        claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on
        benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information.
        The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end
        of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4).
        A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or
        gender are included within the area total but excluded from
        the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small
        disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not
        directly comparable to the annual individual level data
        previously released as they were a single snapshot at a
        point in time and did not reflect late notifications and
        removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are
        based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area
        population estimates published by the General Registrars
        Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Every effort has
        been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the
        disclosure of confidential information and all counts have
        been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to
        base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real
        zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries

        <gms:Description>Pension Credit (PC) were introduced on 6
        October 2003 to replace the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG).
        There are two parts to PC, the Guarantee Credit (GC) and
        the Saving Credit (SC). The GC provides financial help for
        people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain
        level set by the law. The awarded amount will depend on
        other sources of income and extra amounts are added to the
        standard minimum for those who have: relevant housing
        costs; severe disabilities; or caring responsibilities. The
        SC is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have
        made some provision for their retirement (such as savings
        or a second pension) which brings their income above a
        level set by parliament, called the savings credit
        threshold. It is possible to get savings credit on top of
        guarantee credit. For detailed eligibility conditions and
        rules for claiming Pensions Credits see the Pension Service
        website:
        www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/pensioncredit/home.asp. Data
        shown here are derived from a 100% data source; the Work
        and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not subject
        to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts of total
        claimants and disaggregations by age, gender, duration on
        benefit, partnering and some benefit specific information.
        The snapshots are taken at quarterly intervals at the end
        of February (Q1), May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4).
        A very small number of claimants who have an unknown age or
        gender are included within the area total but excluded from
        the age and gender breakdowns as they pose a small
        disclosure risk. Data from the WPLS datasets are not
        directly comparable to the annual individual level data
        previously released as they were a single snapshot at a
        point in time and did not reflect late notifications and
        removals from the systems. Claim rates of GC claimants are
        based on the population aged 60 plus from the small area
        population estimates published by the General Registrars
        Office for Scotland. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October
        2006 when 2005 data will be added to SNS. Every effort has
        been made by the DWP to ensure that data do not allow the
        disclosure of confidential information and all counts have
        been adjusted using a variant of controlled rounding to
        base 5. Any counts that are shown as zero may not be a real
        zero. Source: Department for Work and Pensions. Enquiries

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>Sites of Special Scientific
        Interest ( SSSIs) are identified as "special" for plants,
        animals or habitats, rocks, landforms or a combination of
        these features. SNH selects sites after detailed survey and
        evaluation against scientific criteria. Natura 2000 is an
        EU-wide network made up of sites designated under the EC
        Birds and Habitats Directives. Sites designated under the
        Birds Directive are termed Special Protection Areas (
        SPAs). Sites designated under the Habitats Directive are
        termed Special Areas of Conservation ( SACs). Special
        features mean the habitats, plant or animal species or
        geological or other features of the land for which the site
        was designated. The assessment of favourable condition will
        be made using guidelines produced by the Joint Nature
        Conservation Committee ( JNCC) drawing on the work of the
        national conservation agencies. Favourable condition means
        that the features for which SSSIs or Natura sites are
        designated are in satisfactory condition; or are
        recovering, with the necessary management measures in
        place, such that Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) predicts,
        using expert judgement, that the land will in due course
        reach favourable condition. The target comprises the sum of
        the JNCC Common Standards conditions 'Favourable
        maintained', 'Favourable recovered' and 'Unfavourable
        recovering'. In this context there will be instances where,
        despite all realistic local management actions having been
        put in place, SNH predicts that, owing to wider land use,
        fisheries or other matters beyond its control ( e.g.
        climate change), the condition of certain features is
        likely to remain unfavourable. In these circumstances,
        where all measures within partners' control have been
        taken, failure to ensure the favourable condition of those
        features will be recorded and reported separately. The data
        covers the 6 year period ending the 31st March of the year
        stated.</sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>

        <gms:Description>Incapacity Benefits include Severe
        Disability Allowance (SDA) and Incapacity Benefit (IB). SDA
        was introduced in November 1984, claimantswere aged between
        16 and 65 when they made their claim and been incapable of
        work for at least 28 weeks. There is no upper age limit for
        receiving the allowance once it has been awarded. Since
        April 2001 it has not been possible to make a new claim for
        SDA. IB replaced Sickness and Invalidity Benefits from
        April 1995. It is paid to people who are assessed as being
        incapable of work and who meet the appropriate contribution
        conditions. For people under state pension age there are
        two short-term rates: the lower rate, IBST(L), is paid for
        the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate,
        IBST(H), for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate, IBLT, of
        Incapacity Benefit applies to people under state pension
        age who have been sick for more than a year. People with a
        terminal illness or who are receiving the highest rate care
        component of Disability Living Allowance get the long-term
        rate from week 29. For people over state pension age, the
        short-term rate of Incapacity Benefit, based on Retirement
        Pension entitlement, is paid for up to a year if incapacity
        began before pension age. The long-term rate is not paid
        for people over pension age. For detailed and up-to-date
        eligibility conditions and rules for claiming Severe
        Disablement Allowance or Incapacity Benefit see the DWP
        Website:
        http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/WorkingAgeBenefits/dev_008025.xml.html.
        Data shown here is derived from a 100% data source; the
        Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) which is not
        subject to any sampling error. The dataset provides counts
        of total claimants and breakdowns by age, gender, duration
        on benefit and some benefit specific information. The data
        are from a snapshot in time and will therefore exclude a
        small number of clerically held cases. The snapshots are
        taken at quarterly intervals at the end of February (Q1),
        May (Q2), August (Q3) and November (Q4). A very small
        number of claimants who have an unknown age or gender are
        included within the area total but excluded from the age
        and gender breakdowns as they pose a small disclosure risk.
        The data in the WPLS datasets are not directly comparable
        to the annual individual level data previously released as
        they were a single snapshot at a point in time and did not
        reflect late notifications and removals from the systems.
        Claimant rates for SDA are based on the population aged 16
        plus. Claimant rates for IB are based on the working age
        population (male aged 1664 and females aged 16-59).
        Claimant rates for all incapacity benefits are based on the
        population aged 16 plus. All populations are from small
        area population estimates provided by the General
        Registrars Office for Scotland. Populations denominators
        for higher geographies are based on best-fit 2001
        geographies. Populations denominators for higher
        geographies are based on best-fit 2001 geographies. 2005
        rates are based on 2004 population estimates until October

        population estimates for 1999 and 2000 will be available
        later this year, rates for these years will be published
        then. Every effort has been made by the DWP to ensure that

        <gms:Description>The specific aims of the survey are as
        follows: to provide household and individual information
        previously unavailable in Scotland, particularly to support
        the work of the Scottish Government's transport,
        communities and local government policy areas and the work
        of the Scottish Parliament to permit disaggregation of such
        information both geographically and in terms of population
        sub-groups (such as families with children or the elderly)
        to allow the relationships between social variables within
        households to be examined. This will support
        cross-departmental and inter-departmental policies such as
        those on social justice to allow early detection of
        national trends to allow detailed follow-up surveys of
        sub-samples from the main survey sample, if required. The
        survey questionnaire is in two parts. The highest income
        householder or their spouse/partner completes Part 1 of the
        interview. Once the composition of the household has been
        established, one of the adults in the household is randomly
        selected by the computer to complete Part 2. In all
        households with a single adult, the same person completes
        both parts but as the number of adults in the household
        increases, the probability of the random adult being the
        same as the household respondent declines. The household
        section of the interview deals with topics such as
        household composition, housing and tenure, health, access
        to the internet, cars available to the household, the
        occupation and industry of the highest income householder,
        household income, housing costs and childcare. The random
        adult section deals with individuals' housing change,
        tenure change, experiences of homelessness and housing
        problems, neighbourhood problems, transport and use of the
        internet, public transport, public services, income and
        employment. More information on the Methodology of the
        survey can be found on the SHS website at (
        http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/16002/Methodology
        ) or the 2005/06 Methodology publication (

        <gms:Description>The specific aims of the survey are as
        follows: to provide household and individual information
        previously unavailable in Scotland, particularly to support
        the work of the Scottish Government's transport,
        communities and local government policy areas and the work
        of the Scottish Parliament to permit disaggregation of such
        information both geographically and in terms of population
        sub-groups (such as families with children or the elderly)
        to allow the relationships between social variables within
        households to be examined. This will support
        cross-departmental and inter-departmental policies such as
        those on social justice to allow early detection of
        national trends to allow detailed follow-up surveys of
        sub-samples from the main survey sample, if required. The
        survey questionnaire is in two parts. The highest income
        householder or their spouse/partner completes Part 1 of the
        interview. Once the composition of the household has been
        established, one of the adults in the household is randomly
        selected by the computer to complete Part 2. In all
        households with a single adult, the same person completes
        both parts but as the number of adults in the household
        increases, the probability of the random adult being the
        same as the household respondent declines. The household
        section of the interview deals with topics such as
        household composition, housing and tenure, health, access
        to the internet, cars available to the household, the
        occupation and industry of the highest income householder,
        household income, housing costs and childcare. The random
        adult section deals with individuals' housing change,
        tenure change, experiences of homelessness and housing
        problems, neighbourhood problems, transport and use of the
        internet, public transport, public services, income and
        employment. More information on the Methodology of the
        survey can be found on the SHS website at (
        http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/16002/Methodology

        <gms:Description>The specific aims of the survey are as
        follows: to provide household and individual information
        previously unavailable in Scotland, particularly to support
        the work of the Scottish Government's transport,
        communities and local government policy areas and the work
        of the Scottish Parliament to permit disaggregation of such
        information both geographically and in terms of population
        sub-groups (such as families with children or the elderly)
        to allow the relationships between social variables within
        households to be examined. This will support
        cross-departmental and inter-departmental policies such as
        those on social justice to allow early detection of
        national trends to allow detailed follow-up surveys of
        sub-samples from the main survey sample, if required. The
        survey questionnaire is in two parts. The highest income
        householder or their spouse/partner completes Part 1 of the
        interview. Once the composition of the household has been
        established, one of the adults in the household is randomly
        selected by the computer to complete Part 2. In all
        households with a single adult, the same person completes
        both parts but as the number of adults in the household
        increases, the probability of the random adult being the
        same as the household respondent declines. The household
        section of the interview deals with topics such as
        household composition, housing and tenure, health, access
        to the internet, cars available to the household, the
        occupation and industry of the highest income householder,
        household income, housing costs and childcare. The random
        adult section deals with individuals' housing change,
        tenure change, experiences of homelessness and housing
        problems, neighbourhood problems, transport and use of the
        internet, public transport, public services, income and
        employment. More information on the Methodology of the
        survey can be found on the SHS website at (

        HMRC identified that they had provided incorrect tax credit
        data for the income domain of SIMD 2009 and this affected
        the income domain rank, the overall SIMD rank and the
        percentage of the population who are income deprived. This
        data has now been corrected on SNS. Further details can be
        found on the news page of the SIMD website:
        http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/SIMD/News The
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) provides a
        relative ranking of the data zones in Scotland from 1 (most
        deprived) to 6505 (least deprived) based on a weighted
        combination of data in the domains of Current Income,
        Housing, Health, Education, Skills and Training, Employment
        and Geographic Access and Crime (no Crime data available
        for the SIMD 2004). Each of the domains can also be ranked
        individually. When comparing results from the different
        versions of the SIMD it is important to take into account
        changes to the methodology used to construct the individual
        domains and the overall SIMD between the three indices.

        SIMD it is important to take into account changes to the
        methodology used to construct the individual domains and
        the overall SIMD between the three indices. More

        confidential information and all counts have been adjusted

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Data on leavers destinations is
        matched to data from the pupil census on the basis of
        combinations of Scottish Candidate Number, School, gender,
        date of birth and post code (see
        http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/12/07093501/26
        for details of the 2006/07 exercise, which was repeated for
        2007/08 data, and
        http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/11/20112425/2
        for details of the 2008/09 exercise). Datazones are derived
        from pupils home post codes.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>The indicator is used in the education
        domain of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD)
        2009. It differs from a similar indicator used in SIMD 2006
        which only counted people not in full time higher and
        non-advanced education. The indicator used in SIMD 2004 is
        different again as it counts people not in full time
        non-advanced education. The indicator used in SIMD 2006 is
        not available from the SNS website as it contains
        disclosive benefits data from DWP. A full list of
        indicators used for SIMD 2006 and SIMD 2009 are available
        in the SIMD 2009 Technical Report. Further information
        about the SIMD including a general report and a technical
        report is available from
        www.scotland.gov.uk/simd.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Data are provided by DWP, Careers Scotland
        and ScotXed. Data were aggregated over two years, with the
        intention of reducing the impact of fluctuations from one
        year to the next due to small numbers per data
        zone.</sns:Accuracy>
        <sns:Comparability>The indicator is only comparable between
        SIMD 2009 and the one year update to SIMD 2009. Different
        indicators were used in SIMD 2004 and SIMD
        2006.</sns:Comparability>
        <sns:DisclosureControl>Counts have been adjusted using
        probabilistic rounding to base 5. Any counts that are shown
        as zero may not be a real zero. Unrounded data used in

        <gms:Description>Information on the destination of leavers
        from publicly funded schools is provided to the Scottish
        Government by Skills Development Scotland. The data relate
        to the latest known destination of leavers in the September
        of the school year after they left. For example, a school
        leaver who left in June 2009 and travelled for several
        months but who is known to have taken up employment prior
        to September will be counted under 'employment' for the
        2008 figures (because they left at the end of the 2008/09
        year). For more information please see the publication
        Destinations of Leavers from Scottish Schools which is
        available at the following link
        http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/Publications
        Higher Education: includes leavers following HND (Higher
        National Diploma) or HNC (Higher National Certificate)
        courses, degree courses, courses for the education and
        training of teachers and higher level courses for
        professional qualifications. It also includes programmes at
        a level higher than the standard of the New National
        Qualifications (Intermediate 1, Intermediate 2, the new
        Higher) which were introduced in 1999/00, Advanced Higher,
        introduced in 2001, Scottish Certificate of Sixth Year
        Studies, and the National Certificate of Education of
        England, Wales or Northern Ireland at Advanced Level.
        Leavers with a deferred, unconditional place in higher
        education have also been included in this
        category.</gms:Description>

        Unemployed and seeking employment or training: includes
        those who are registered with Skills Development Scotland
        and are known by them to be seeking employment or training.
        This is based on regular contact between Skills Development
        Scotland and the client. This does not refer to the
        definition of 'unemployed' used by the Benefits Agency to

        seeking employment or training: includes all those
        individuals who are not seeking employment or training for
        a range of reasons. The reasons may involve sickness,
        prison, pregnancy, caring for children or other dependents,
        or taking time out. NOTE: the above two categories are

        <gms:Description>Information on the destination of leavers

        Government by Skills Development Scotland. The data relate
        to the latest known destination of leavers in the September
        of the school year after they left. For example, a school
        leaver who left in June 2009 and travelled for several
        months but who is known to have taken up employment prior
        to September will be counted under 'employment' for the
        2008 figures (because they left at the end of the 2008/09
        year). For more information please see the publication

        <gms:Description>Information on the destination of leavers
        from publicly funded schools is provided to the Scottish
        Government by Skills Development Scotland. The data relate
        to the latest known destination of leavers in the September
        of the school year after they left. For example, a school
        leaver who left in June 2009 and travelled for several
        months but who is known to have taken up employment prior
        to September will be counted under 'employment' for the
        2008 figures (because they left at the end of the 2008/09
        year). For more information please see the publication
        Destinations of Leavers from Scottish Schools which is
        available at the following link
        http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/Publications.
        Unemployed and seeking employment or training: includes
        those who are registered with Skills Development Scotland
        and are known by them to be seeking employment or training.
        This is based on regular contact between Skills Development
        Scotland and the client. This does not refer to the
        definition of 'unemployed' used by the Benefits Agency to
        calculate published unemployment rates. Unemployed and not
        seeking employment or training: includes all those
        individuals who are not seeking employment or training for
        a range of reasons. The reasons may involve sickness,
        prison, pregnancy, caring for children or other dependents,
        or taking time out. NOTE: the above two categories are
        comparable to the single 'other known destination' which
        was used prior to 2002/03.</gms:Description>

        the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census
        for the relevant year, which was carried out through the
        Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project.
        The year shown relates to that in which the Census was
        carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations
        were taken i.e.the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09.
        More information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net . A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Exam Results Data on
        National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish
        Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These
        data are linked to the pupil information from the Census
        using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible
        number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a
        variety of reasons. For more information please see the

        Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken
        from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant
        year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange
        of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown

        information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results

        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Exam Results Data on
        National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish
        Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These
        data are linked to the pupil information from the Census
        using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible

        <gms:Description>This indicator relates to pupils attending
        publicly funded secondary schools, it does not include:
        Pupils attending publicly funded Special Schools; Pupils
        attending private Independent Schools; Pupils educated
        outwith the school education system (for example at home)
        or Adults attending publicly funded secondary schools.
        Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken
        from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant
        year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange
        of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown
        relates to that in which the Census was carried out as
        opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e.
        the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More
        information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Exam Results Data on
        National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish
        Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These
        data are linked to the pupil information from the Census
        using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible
        number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a
        variety of reasons. For more information please see the

        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support
        Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as
        having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of
        Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are
        categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam
        Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from
        the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are
        post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil
        information from the Census using pupil's Scottish
        Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is
        not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

        <gms:Description>This indicator relates to pupils attending
        publicly funded secondary schools, it does not include:
        Pupils attending publicly funded Special Schools; Pupils
        attending private Independent Schools; Pupils educated
        outwith the school education system (for example at home)
        or Adults attending publicly funded secondary schools.
        Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken
        from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant
        year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange
        of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown
        relates to that in which the Census was carried out as
        opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e.
        the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More
        information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support
        Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as
        having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of
        Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are
        categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam
        Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from
        the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are
        post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil
        information from the Census using pupil's Scottish
        Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is
        not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

        <gms:Description>This indicator relates to pupils attending
        publicly funded secondary schools, it does not include:
        Pupils attending publicly funded Special Schools; Pupils
        attending private Independent Schools; Pupils educated
        outwith the school education system (for example at home)
        or Adults attending publicly funded secondary schools.
        Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken
        from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant
        year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange
        of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown
        relates to that in which the Census was carried out as
        opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e.
        the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More
        information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Exam Results Data on
        National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish
        Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These
        data are linked to the pupil information from the Census
        using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible
        number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a
        variety of reasons. For more information please see the

        the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census
        for the relevant year, which was carried out through the
        Scottish Exchange of Educational Data ( ScotXed ) project.
        The year shown relates to that in which the Census was

        More information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Exam Results Data on
        National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish
        Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These

        <gms:Description>This indicator relates to pupils attending
        publicly funded secondary schools, it does not include:
        Pupils attending publicly funded Special Schools; Pupils
        attending private Independent Schools; Pupils educated
        outwith the school education system (for example at home)
        or Adults attending publicly funded secondary schools.
        Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken
        from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant
        year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange
        of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown
        relates to that in which the Census was carried out as
        opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e.
        the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More
        information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support
        Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as
        having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of
        Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are
        categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam
        Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from
        the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are
        post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil
        information from the Census using pupil's Scottish
        Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is
        not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

        the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More
        information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Exam Results Data on
        National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish
        Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These
        data are linked to the pupil information from the Census
        using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible

        <gms:Description>This indicator relates to pupils attending
        publicly funded secondary schools, it does not include:
        Pupils attending publicly funded Special Schools; Pupils
        attending private Independent Schools; Pupils educated
        outwith the school education system (for example at home)
        or Adults attending publicly funded secondary schools.
        Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken
        from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant
        year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange
        of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown
        relates to that in which the Census was carried out as
        opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e.
        the year the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More
        information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Exam Results Data on
        National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish
        Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These
        data are linked to the pupil information from the Census
        using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible
        number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a
        variety of reasons. For more information please see the

        <gms:Description>This indicator relates to pupils attending
        publicly funded secondary schools, it does not include:
        Pupils attending publicly funded Special Schools; Pupils
        attending private Independent Schools; Pupils educated
        outwith the school education system (for example at home)
        or Adults attending publicly funded secondary schools.
        Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken
        from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant
        year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange
        of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown
        relates to that in which the Census was carried out as
        opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e.
        the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More
        information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support
        Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as
        having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of
        Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are
        categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam
        Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from
        the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are
        post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil
        information from the Census using pupil's Scottish
        Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is
        not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

        <gms:Description>This indicator relates to pupils attending
        publicly funded secondary schools, it does not include:
        Pupils attending publicly funded Special Schools; Pupils
        attending private Independent Schools; Pupils educated
        outwith the school education system (for example at home)
        or Adults attending publicly funded secondary schools.
        Pupil Numbers The number of pupils on the roll is taken
        from the September Scottish School Census for the relevant
        year, which was carried out through the Scottish Exchange
        of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. The year shown
        relates to that in which the Census was carried out as
        opposed to that in which the examinations were taken i.e.
        the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More
        information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support
        Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as
        having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of
        Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are
        categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam
        Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from
        the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are
        post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil
        information from the Census using pupil's Scottish
        Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is
        not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

        Schools; Pupils attending private Independent Schools;
        Pupils educated outwith the school education system (for
        example at home) or Adults attending publicly funded
        secondary schools. Pupil Numbers: The number of pupils on
        the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census
        for the relevant year, which was carried out through the
        Scottish Exchange of Educational Data ( ScotXed ) project.
        The year shown relates to that in which the Census was
        carried out as opposed to that in which the examinations
        were taken i.e.the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09.
        More information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Exam Results Data on
        National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish
        Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These
        data are linked to the pupil information from the Census
        using pupil's Scottish Candidate Numbers. For a negligible
        number of pupils it is not possible to make this link for a
        variety of reasons. For more information please see the
        background notes to the publication 'SQA Attainment and
        School Leaver Qualifications in Scotland', available here:

        the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09. More
        information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Additional Support
        Needs (ASN): Pupils identified in the School Census as
        having either a Co-ordinated Support Plan, a Record of
        Needs or an Individualised Education Programme are
        categorised as having Additional Support Needs. Exam
        Results Data on National Qualifications are obtained from
        the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are
        post-appeals. These data are linked to the pupil
        information from the Census using pupil's Scottish
        Candidate Numbers. For a negligible number of pupils it is
        not possible to make this link for a variety of reasons.

        the roll is taken from the September Scottish School Census
        for the relevant year, which was carried out through the
        Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project.
        The year shown relates to that in which the Census was

        were taken i.e.the year 2008 is the academic year 2008/09.
        More information on the ScotXed project is available on
        www.scotxed.net. A range of information was collected for
        each individual pupil, including the pupil home postcode.
        This has been used to generate the number of pupils at
        various levels of geographical aggregation. Results
        contained in the SNS School Education Indictors do not
        include the few pupils with a missing or invalid postcode.
        Therefore, the national figures may not be the same as
        national figures published elsewhere. Exam Results Data on
        National Qualifications are obtained from the Scottish
        Qualifications Authority (SQA) and are post-appeals. These

        <gms:Description>Gross Domestic Product ( GDP) is a measure
        of the value added to materials and other inputs in the
        production of goods and services by resident organisations;
        before allowing for depreciation or capital consumption. In
        accordance with UK National Accounting principles, the oil
        and gas sector are excluded from the analysis as this is
        not attributed to any one area of the UK - termed
        "extra-regio" activity. Net receipts from interest, profits
        and dividends abroad are also excluded. There are two
        measures of GDP, market prices and basic prices. The
        estimates produced for Scotland are measured in basic
        prices, which excludes taxes less subsidies on products
        (taxes on products include VAT and excise duties). Gross
        Value Added ( GVA) is another term for GDP at basic prices.
        Annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates for
        Scotland are calculated on a rolling four quarters on four
        quarters basis this compares annual growth to the year end
        of the most recent quarter.</gms:Description>

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table
        below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of
        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table
        below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of
        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to
        be those with high levels of migration - for example,
        student areas.</sns:Accuracy>

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table
        below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of
        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to
        be those with high levels of migration - for example,

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table

        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service

        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table
        below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of
        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to
        be those with high levels of migration - for example,
        student areas.</sns:Accuracy>

        <gms:Description>This indicator is an estimate of the male
        population aged between 10 and 15. The population estimates
        are derived using the cohort-component method where
        Census-based estimates are updated annually by ageing on
        the population and applying information on births, deaths
        and migration. Births and deaths are estimated using data
        from the civil registration system. Migration is derived
        from three main sources: the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international
        migration.</gms:Description>

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table
        below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of
        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to
        be those with high levels of migration - for example,

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table
        below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of
        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to
        be those with high levels of migration - for example,

        <gms:Description>This indicator is an estimate of the male
        population aged between 70 and 74. The population estimates
        are derived using the cohort-component method where
        Census-based estimates are updated annually by ageing on
        the population and applying information on births, deaths
        and migration. Births and deaths are estimated using data
        from the civil registration system. Migration is derived
        from three main sources: the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international
        migration.</gms:Description>

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table
        below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of
        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to
        be those with high levels of migration - for example,

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table
        below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of
        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to
        be those with high levels of migration - for example,

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table
        below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of
        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to
        be those with high levels of migration - for example,
        student areas.</sns:Accuracy>

        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to
        be those with high levels of migration - for example,
        student areas.</sns:Accuracy>

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table
        below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of
        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to
        be those with high levels of migration - for example,

        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Up until the 2008 population
        estimates were published Scotland, Local Authority and
        Health Board level figures were aggregated from data zones.
        As a result the published GROS 2001-2007 mid-year
        population estimates for health boards were slightly
        different than those on SNS. This anomally has now been
        rectified and the HB data published on SNS now matches that
        published on GROS for all years. Data zone population
        estimates are aggregated to create data for several other
        geographies on SNS (indicated by the plus sign in the table
        below). Data zone boundaries do not always match those of
        other geographies, so a 'best-fit' approach is used when
        aggregating the data zones.</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance>Population estimates are used in a variety
        of applications. For example, in the calculation of the
        Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>Population estimates are based on the 2001
        Census and updated annually by 'ageing on' the population
        and applying information on births, deaths and migration.
        Births and deaths are estimated using data from the civil
        registration system, which is considered to be virtually
        complete. Migration is more difficult to estimate because
        there is no comprehensive registration system in the UK.
        Migration is derived from the National Health Service
        Central Register (NHSCR) and Community Health Index (CHI)
        for migration within the UK, and from the International
        Passenger Survey (IPS) for international migration. The
        sample size for Scotland for the IPS is small, so estimates
        derived from this survey are subject to large sampling and
        non-sampling errors. GROS is conducting an on-going
        exercise to improve the quality of data zone population
        estimates. Areas where estimates are less reliable tend to
        be those with high levels of migration - for example,

        <gms:Description>Information on homeless applications in
        Scotland is provided to the Scottish Government by Local
        Authorities across Scotland in the HL1 statistical return.
        The return contains information on the characteristics and
        circumstances of each homeless applicant household,
        including applicant ethnicity, gender and age, and also the
        assessment and outcome of the application. This indicator
        gives the percentage of homeless households in Scotland
        where the main applicant's ethnicity was white which were
        assessed as priority homeless. For more information, please
        see the publication of statistics on the operation of the
        homeless persons legislation in Scotland, which can be
        found by following this link:

        around 15,000 paired social and physical households and
        dwellings. Since 2003, the SHCS moved to a continuous

        2007 and 2008 with a sample size of around 3,000 paired
        cases per year. The SHCS can provide national estimates
        annually and for Local Authority estimates, due to the
        sample sample size, the most recent 3 years worth of data
        are combined. LA figures for Fuel Poverty can be found in a

        Districts are excluded. In addition to this non-residential
        addresses; residential accommodation not used by the

        Prior to 2003, the Scottish House Condition Survey was
        conducted in 1991, 1996 and 2002 with sample sizes of
        around 15,000 paired social and physical households and
        dwellings. Since 2003, the SHCS moved to a continuous
        format with surveys annually for 2003/4, 2004/5, 2005/6,
        2007 and 2008 with a sample size of around 3,000 paired
        cases per year. The SHCS can provide national estimates
        annually and for Local Authority estimates, due to the
        sample sample size, the most recent 3 years worth of data
        are combined. LA figures for Fuel Poverty can be found in a

        <sns:Relevance>This data is collected on an annual basis
        from the STATS-19 police returns.</sns:Relevance>
        <sns:Accuracy>The injury road accident statistics produced
        from police forces' STATS-19 returns cannot be
        comprehensive. The police can only report details of the
        accidents that they are aware of. There may be more
        accidents not reported to the police, therefore they would
        not appear in the STATS-19 returns. Totals include cases
        where gender is unknown.</sns:Accuracy>
        <sns:Comparability>The figures have been compared to GROS
        figures and do provide a reliable measure of the level of,
        and trends in the number of road deaths. Comparisons with
        hospital figures suggest that pedal cyclists are
        under-reported in the police returns.</sns:Comparability>

        <sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>The indicator covers employed
        adults (people aged 16 and over, whose current situation
        was described as "self-employed", "employed full-time" or
        "employed part-time") for whom a usual means of travel to
        work was recorded. The figures do not include people who
        work at or from home. " Car" includes "van"; the figures
        cover both drivers and passengers. The usual main method of
        travel to work is recorded if the method varies, or the
        journey involves more than one
        method.</sns:ConceptsAndDefinitions>
        <sns:GeographicReferencing>Annual data available at
        Scotland level only. To obtain Local Authority level data 2
        years worth of data need to be combined combined, due to
        sample sizes. This is available as a separate
        indicator</sns:GeographicReferencing>
        <sns:Relevance />
        <sns:Accuracy>As with all survey based indicators, figures
        are subject to sampling variability and only changes that
        are statistically significant (i.e. greater than the
        confidence limit) are likely to be an actual change. Each
        year's figure is based on a sample of around 6,000 adults
        who travel to work. The "95% confidence limits" are
        believed to be about +/- 1.4
        percentage-points.</sns:Accuracy>
